  Automatically bridge third party hue lights to HomeKit.
  <br><br>
  Since philips hue does not enable HomeKit for third party ZigBee devices, this project aims to close the gap.
  It automatically detects, whether a light is an original device or a third party device and then bridges it
  to HomeKit.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Golang (>=1.14.3)
- Make
- golint (‚úÖ tests/linting)
- staticcheck (‚úÖ tests/linting)
- gosec (‚úÖ tests/linting)


## üîß Usage/Installation

- Download the released package for your operating system or follow the build instructions
- Retrieve the ip address of the bridge in the hue app (Settings > Hue Bridges > i near the [Bridge Name])
- Place the config.yml, that is contained in the release package or from [./configs/config.yml](./configs/config.yml), near the retrieved binary.
- Open the config.yml and insert the ip address in the `''` behind the `bridge_address` key
- Change the `homekit_pin` to a random 8-digit pin
- Run `./huekit`
- Check, if it says, that you need to press the link button. If so, press the button to authenticate huekit at your hue bridge
- Open the Home app on your apple device and click on the top right `+` icon to add an accessory.
- Tap on "I Don't Have A Code or Cannot Scan"
- Select `HueKit` and insert the code from the `config.yml`, that is configured after the `homekit_pin` key


**Hint** In order to reset the huekit, remove the `huekit_data` directory near the binary.


## üèó Build

In order to build the binary, just run `make build`. The binary will be placed in the `./bin` directory.


## üê≥ Docker

This project features a Dockerfile, docker-compose file and the way to read the configuration from the environment.
The Dockerfile can be found in `build/package/docker/huekit` and the docker-compose.yml in `deployments/docker`.
For building an image for different OS and CPU architextures, the Dockerfile features build arguments, that allow cross compiling the binary.
The docker-compose.yml features a configuration for linux/amd64 and linux/armv7 (compatible with raspberry pi).


Configuration of the docker containers can be done by setting environment variable, such that a config file is not required anymore.
All configuration parameters of the config.yml can be reused with the prefix `HUEKIT_` in order to be set via the environment.
An example configuration can be found in the docker-compose.yml.
The following environment variables are available:


| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `HUEKIT_LOG_LEVEL` | Set the verbosity of the service. |
| `HUEKIT_LOG_FORMAT` | Decide, if you want `json` or `text` logs |
| `HUEKIT_BRIDGE_ADDRESS` | IP address of the hue bridge  |
| `HUEKIT_HOMEKIT_PIN` | Pin, that must be entered in homekit for pairing with huekit |
| `HUEKIT_HOMEKIT_PORT` | Port that huekit will listen on for homekit  |
